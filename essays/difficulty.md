As someone who is experienced with Javascript, Typescript feels very easy to learn and work with, which makes sense because it is basically the same language.  Typescript does feel more restrictive and removes some of the freedom that can come with working in javascript.  This is both good and bad because it can be more frustrating to work with, but it does enforce good coding practices and helps to catch bugs early when they are still very easy to fix.  It also helps with enforcing better cybersecurity practices.

The practice WODs are kind of helpful if you haven't worked in typescript before, but if you have the only real blocker on the WODs is the badly written instructions.  The instructions being written the way they are really encourages AI usage because it can be difficult to track down how you are supposed to handle edge cases hidden inside the instructions while trying to work quickly under a 20-40 minute time crunch.  Using an AI to read the instructions and do the work for you is a much more effective way to handle the assignment, and allows you time to fully read through the instructions and then confirm that the AI properly handled the edge cases.  This makes for really bad practice if you are actually trying to learn how to code in Typescript.

I find the flipped class format that ICS 314 uses to be very frustrating and a much worse experience than actually being taught in class.  I generally find online classes and lectures to be ineffective and difficult to fully focus on, which is why I only take in person classes.  It can be difficult to get the content from the material on the website, and it is very annoying to not be able to ask questions as the lesson goes on.  It has also already led to some confusion regarding due dates because the dates are listed differently on Lamaku vs the course website.  In general in person classes are just a better learning experience overall.
